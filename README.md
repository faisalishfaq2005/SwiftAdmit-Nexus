> “First semester enthusiasm hits differently — I wrote 12,000+ lines of C++ for this project.  
> Efficiency? Not much. Determination? Off the charts. 😅”

## 🧩 Overview

This project is a **terminal-based College Application System** built entirely in **raw C++** — no frameworks, no fancy UI libraries, just pure logic and endless `cout` statements.

It allows students to apply to multiple U.S. universities through a single platform, complete their profile, submit essays, and track admission decisions. On the other side, universities can log in, view submitted applications, and make admission decisions.
